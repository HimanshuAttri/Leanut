# Leanut - The Social Bot


A social chatbot for people in depression and suicidal condition. Leanut advices the victim accordin to his state of mind. Leanut also provides a human interaction to victim by search one of such users who are willing to help the victim.

## Concept

These day depression and suicidal tendencies had increased a lot. A victim who is on the verge to end his life will not want to interact with a bot, knowing bot can never understand his/her feelings, bot really can't accuately guss victims mood in such crutial time and hence we should not build a platform entirely based on a learned bot because highly learned AIs are also not so good at emotional inteligence.

Hence Leanut provides personal assitance and advices victim initially and even then if a user wants to have a chat with a real human he can call for it. 
### Leanut is a facebook bot, and fb network is so huge, hence if a person who is depressed and one of another person who wants to help someone can join each other in a chat anonymously. Being anonymous the user can share his/her thoughts without any fear

Peaople who need help and those who want to help people in need are now not required to go a perticular site or forum to help or get helped, ### Leanut will provide a anonymous connection over facebook.


## Technology Used

For the time being if users want to send message to each other the '/r' should be used in the begaining of the message

##Works to be done

-removing '/r' operations with a normal send
#### Initially app cannot be used by normal users, It needs to be authorized by facebook before deploying fully online the process will take time,hence for now it works only on my two accounts with fb developer keys, I will apply for autherisation of the app so that any fb user can use it
